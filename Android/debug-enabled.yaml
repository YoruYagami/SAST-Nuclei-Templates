  description: |
    This template detects if the `android:debuggable` attribute is set to `true` in the Android manifest file. When an application is debuggable, it is easier for attackers to reverse engineer and exploit. This setting should be disabled in production releases.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that the `android:debuggable` attribute is set to `false` or removed entirely in the production manifest file. Example:

    ```xml
    <application
        android:debuggable="false"
        ... >
        ...
    </application>
    ```

file:
  - extensions:
      - all

    matchers:
      - type: regex
        regex:
          - "android:debuggable=\"true\""
