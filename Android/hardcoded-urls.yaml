  description: |
    This template detects hardcoded URLs in the source code. Hardcoding URLs can lead to security issues if the URLs are not properly validated or if they point to untrusted sources.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, avoid hardcoding URLs in the source code. Use configuration files or environment variables to manage URLs. Ensure that URLs are properly validated before use. Example:

    ```java
    String baseUrl = BuildConfig.BASE_URL;
    ```

file:
  - extensions:
      - java
      - xml

    matchers:
      - type: regex
        regex:
          - "http(s)?://[^\"]+"
