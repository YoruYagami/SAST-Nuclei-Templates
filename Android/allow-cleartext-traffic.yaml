  name: Allow Cleartext Traffic
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template detects if cleartext traffic is allowed in the Android manifest file. Allowing cleartext traffic (HTTP) can expose sensitive data to network sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks. It is recommended to enforce HTTPS to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, set the `usesCleartextTraffic` attribute to `false` in the applicationâ€™s network security configuration. Example:

    ```xml
    <application
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"
        ... >
        ...
    </application>
    ```

file:
  - extensions:
      - xml

      - type: word
        words:
          - "android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\""
