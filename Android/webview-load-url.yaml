  description: |
    This template detects the use of the `loadUrl` method in WebView. Loading URLs directly in WebView can expose the application to security risks, especially if the URLs are not from trusted sources or are dynamically constructed.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that URLs loaded in WebView are from trusted sources and implement validation checks. Example:

    ```java
    webView.loadUrl("https://trusted.domain.com");
    ```
